# Shape Area Measurement System

## Overview
In this project we develop a computer vision system that detects closed curves on a white surface and calculates their area using a reference scale. Implemented with Python and OpenCV, the system processes images from a camera to identify shapes and compute precise measurements.

## Features
- Shape detection using contour analysis
- Reference-based scaling with colored markers
- Real-time area calculation
- Interactive user interface
- Image processing pipeline (grayscale, blur, binary conversion)

## Notes

This project was completed as a part of the Computer Structure and Language course.
